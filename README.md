# Mondrian-Composition-II
Project from Coder: Create your own Mondrian

Piet Mondrian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) is one of my favorite artists! I recreated his grid-based "Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow" artwork (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_Red_Blue_and_Yellow) in-browser using HTML & CSS.
